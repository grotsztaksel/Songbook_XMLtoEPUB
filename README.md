# songbook
A Kindle-friendly songbook generator

This project offers a suite of tools allowing automated transformation of a songbook defined in an XML file, or set of files into a form of EPUB compliant HTML files*. These can then be converted into an eBook by other tools**. 

\* The "EPUB compliant" means that an example EPUB file has been reverse engineered and a set of files essential for successful creation of an eBook has been defined.

** I found [Calibre](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre) particularly useful: note it has a command line mode that can easily be used in an automated way aling with this
