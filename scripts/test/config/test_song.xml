        |Check the |same num|ber of chords in the |line     &gt;    c h O r
        Check |more chords than ins|ertion points           &gt;    c h o r d
        Check more ins|ertion |points |than chords          &gt;    c h
        Check if the following lines
        Will be groupped 
        Outside a HTML table
        And then next line with chords and no               &gt;    c h
        Insertion points                                    &gt;    c h

        Now a verse without any chords
        Expecting them to be in one paragraph
        Without any tables created
        So that the user can tap just anywhere
        To turn the page

    <chorus chord_mode="CHORDS_BESIDE">
        |Say, we want |to sing |a cho|rus,                      &gt;    c h O r
        Where |the chords are |defined beside                   &gt;    c h O r d
        Re|gardless |of the |insertion points |marked           &gt;    c h
        We want to see the tables for only those verses
        Where the chords are given
        And the rest just in a plain div section
        Unless new chords are given for a line                  &gt;    c h
        Exactly like here                                       &gt;    c
    </chorus>
