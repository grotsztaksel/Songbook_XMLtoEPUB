<h3>Note</h3>
<p>
    The SongEbook does not actually create the ready-to use e-book (see <a href="./workflow.xhtml">workflow</a>)
    As mentioned above, it generates a set of HTML files plus metadata. The actual EPUB is a zip-compressed set of such
    HTML and metadata, and since there's lots of ZIP compressors out there, everyone can find his or her favourite to
    plug into the workflow to create the final file ready to use on the ebook reader
